## Project for machine learning mid term

Project idea: display realtime information about object detected by webcamera. 

Project future vision: make an object detection service that can be trained by customer and then used to identify custom objects, for example on factory line or conveyor belt + implement custom rules for certain objects and take picture if custom object is detected. 

Possible scenario: 
  if rat is detected in the camera (on food production line) - make a signal, take a photo and send photo by email.
